== Handlers

Handlers are where request processing logic is provided.
A `Handler` is a functional interface defined as `void handle(Context context)` and can be easily expressed as a Groovy `Closure`.
The context is a registry that provides access to a map-like data-structure that can be populated and queried.
Request and response objects are accessible via the `Handler`.

=== Request Response Interaction

As an implementation detail of the TodoBackend application, we need to set CORS headers on each response.

[source, groovy]

----

----
<1> Access the response's headers from the `Context`
<2> Add some headers for implementing CORS functionality

<1> Invoke our Ratpack Groovy script
<2> Issue curl and inspect response headers to verify that our CORS headers are added

=== Organization

Because our REST implementation requires that CORS is enabled, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` headers need to be set on every response.
However, setting these headers in each `Handler` is tedious and error prone.
Luckily `Handler` s are designed to be composable units of request processing.
Handlers are composed in a logical manner via the `Chain`.
Handlers can either send a response or delegate further request processing to the next `Handler` in the `Chain`.
Handlers signal delegation via `Context#next`.

We'll start our refactoring by extracting the CORS setting logic to its own handler.

[source, groovy]
.{groovy}/ratpack2.groovy
----
include::../{groovy}/ratpack2.groovy[]
----
<1> Declare a new handler to handle all incoming requests regardless of method or path
<2> Delegate processing to the next `Handler` in the chain

We can curl the application to make sure that the headers are indeed being set for each request.

<1> Run `ratpack2.groovy` script
<2> Verify that CORS headers were added to `GET /` endpoint
<3> Verify that CORS headers were added to undefined `GET /no-such-path` endpoint
<4> Verify that CORS headers were added to unsupported `POST /` endpoint

=== Standalone Handlers

As you can imagine, the number of handlers in your chain can quickly grow.
Ratpack provides ways to evolve your code base as your handlers and chains grow.

The idea is to migrate handling logic to discrete classes or groups of classes in order to keep your codebase readable and maintainable.

[source, groovy]
.{groovy}/ratpack3.groovy
----
include::../{groovy}/ratpack3.groovy[]
----
<1> Extract our CORS handling logic to its own class
<2> Add the newly migrated `CORSHandler` to our Chain
